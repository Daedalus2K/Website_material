        This website is being created to provide an overview of all the things
        that have been covered already by the previous lessons. Don't expect anything
        serious to appear here. However, I will try and attempt to implement all
        the little items mentioned throughout the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS material.

<!--
 1. Text box must be white 
 2. Images and Image labeling (find 3 to 4 nice images)
 3. Pad the images on the sides
 4. Written material (fake addresses?,etc)
 5. Make a header with an image of a rising sun
 6. Make a table of items
 7. Try to find a way to get special fonts onto the website
 8. Make the padding of an image change color when the mouse hovers over them.
